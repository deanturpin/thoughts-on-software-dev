# Limited by your imagination
It's usually used as a motivational mantra but actually we are. Quite often
Eureka moments are accidental

# Use software as the end user
How can you include the things you write into your daily routine? It's really
difficult. Perhaps you could just use a small part of something. Perhaps
overlay the results of the API read you're working on into your commute website
with Greasemonkey?

# Interruptions
Interruptions can really mess with your flow. It's easy to interrupt the person
next to you but it's no good for them. I'm conscious of not stopping somebody
when they're deep in the middle of something, waiting until somebody else
interrupts them (...) or just sending an email instead.

# Pseudo code
The use of ad-hoc, informal code is common in high-level documents but is prone
to ambiguities. Why not use actual code?

# Communication with non-technical people

# Minimise mutable state
A philosophy I hadn't considered until I started looking at functional
programming. Minimise side effects.

# Embracing Wagile
There are a whole generation of system engineers and managers who aren't letting
waterfall go any time soon.

How can we embrace wagile?

Often managers consider Agile as leaping capriciously between ideas when the
important thing for me is dropping the things that seemed like a good idea but
don't work in practice.

We should be open to new solutions all the time.

# Code editors
Often use vim for configuring embedded systems (sometimes the only way) but for
larger code bases where there are a lot of files to keep in your head it's
better to use an IDE.

# Lint
Recently move to using clang-format and the LLVM VIM config. I'm not yet sure
where this fits into my workflow.

# Compiler optimisation
I normally prefer to defer enabling compiler optimisation until the code is
mature. Only then can you 

# Touch typing
Often not taken seriously - espectially with older engineers -

# Commit often
Make the merge easier
